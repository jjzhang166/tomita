/*
SolveAmbiguityRecursive finds the longest non-intersected set of periods,
which  includes period A.

This function recieves the following:
1. A base set of periods  "Occurrences", which have intersections.
2. A position in the set of periods "Start", from which an ambiguous ( = with intersections)
part starts;


The output parameter are:
1.  "Solution", which is the maximal possible unambiguous subset of
Occurrences that includes period Start.
2.  "MaxRightBorder" is  the maximal right border, to which extends the ambigous set of periods.
MaxRightBorder can be
    1. the end of the whole text;
    2. the start of the first unambiguous period;
    3. the point which doesn't belong to any period.
The return value is coverage of this maximal solution i.e.
length(Solution[0]) + ... length(Solution[Solution.size() - 1])
